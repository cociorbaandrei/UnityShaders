# UnityShaders

This is the source code to older versions and experimental versions of my shaders for effects, avatars and worlds. Some of the shaders in this collection are deprecated and should probably not be used. But others are really nice additions. Feel free to use these, or use them as reference for writing your own shaders.

*Avatar* / *World*:

You probably came here for this, in which case you want to go here:
