# UnityShaders
A collection of Unity Shaders I wrote and use for various things.

*Avatar* / *World*:
A general all purpose shader, designed to be light weight and usable on mobile devices such as the quest and go.

If you've come here, you are probably looking for this. The repository has been moved!
 The toon shader that I use for just about everything.

*The rest*:

 Just random stuff I made as experiments and for fun.
